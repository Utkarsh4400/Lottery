# Decentralized lottery application

### In this project I have created a Smart Contract using Remix IDE.

###  Features:
#### The first line of code we write is to create a contract which is followed by the name of the contract, we create two main variables which are the manager who calls the contract and the players who stake in the lottery. The manager will determine when the winner is picked but does not have any say or influence in who becomes the winner as we will talk about that later.
#### I created a function next that only allows the manager to call the lottery with his own address, we will see how it plays out in the coming lines.
#### I created the next function that we call random and make it private this is the function that we create to make the contract randomly select a winner using the following.
